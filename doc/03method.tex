\section{Technology}
We took the opportunity to explore some of the newest technologies
and thus the game engine and agents were implemented using an early develepor preview of Python 3.10
\footnote{\url{https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100a7/}}.

\subsection{Monte Carlo Tree Search}
For the Monte Carlo tree search, we followed the fundamental principle in implementing the heuristic search algorithm. Each round of evaluation of the best possible move consists of four steps:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Selection
    \item Expansion
    \item Simulation
    \item Backpropagation
\end{itemize}
In our implementation, we try to follow the steps mentioned above.

The basic functionality of our algorithm is to play a given number of simulations until a winner is determined. During the simulation phase, a score is kept for every simulation, which defines the move's efficiency for the AI to win. Afterwards, the best possible action, based on the highest score, is then chosen and returned.
