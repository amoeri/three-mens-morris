As part of the game theory lecture, we implemented the game Three Men's Morris and bots (agents) that play the game, at random, using the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta-pruning or Monte Carlo tree search.
Evaluation of these agents with several different parameters, such as search depth, has show that the Minimax algorithm returns the best results, within an acceptable time-frame (under 1 minute per move).
Monte Carlo tree search has on the other side proven to be most efficient under strict time constraints.
During our project, we were able to find a winning strategy for the player going first, guaranteeing a win in every case.
